Engineering ethics extends beyond individual decision-making to encompass the broader sociotechnical systems in which engineers operate. It requires an understanding of how technical designs interact with organizational incentives, regulatory structures, and public trust. Engineers are ethically obligated to hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public, even when doing so conflicts with cost, schedule, or competitive pressures. Ethical practice therefore demands not only technical competence, but also moral judgment, transparency, and the willingness to challenge assumptions embedded within complex systems.

This project presents a **holistic ethical analysis of the Boeing 737 MAX crisis,** conducted as part of MAE 4300: Engineers and Society at Cornell University.

### Overview of the Boeing 737 MAX Crisis
The Boeing 737 MAX crisis represents one of the most consequential engineering failures in modern aviation history. Two catastrophic crashes—Lion Air Flight 610 in October 2018 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 in March 2019—killed 346 people within five months. Subsequent investigations revealed not a single technical malfunction, but a convergence of flawed design decisions, organizational pressures, and regulatory breakdowns. At the center of the crisis was the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), a flight-control software system intended to improve aircraft handling characteristics but which ultimately contributed directly to both accidents.

My analysis draws on the PBS FRONTLINE documentary Boeing’s Fatal Flaw, the FAA Oversight of Boeing 737 MAX Certification Timeline Final Report, and the ethical frameworks developed during MAE 4300. Using these sources, I approached the crisis not as an isolated design error, but as a **systemic ethical failure shaped by institutional incentives and constrained decision-making.**

### Ethical Failures in Design and Certification
The 737 MAX crisis shows how ethical problems can arise when safety-based engineering judgment is overridden by business and organizational pressures. To address handling changes caused by larger, forward-mounted engines, Boeing introduced the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS). While intended to improve aircraft stability, MCAS was designed to rely on input from a single angle-of-attack sensor, was given substantial authority over the aircraft’s horizontal stabilizer, and could activate repeatedly without clear pilot awareness of the system’s operation. Despite internal warnings and simulator tests revealing that these design choices could lead to loss of control, the system was certified without adequate redundancy, comprehensive pilot training, or full disclosure of its behavior.

From an engineering ethics perspective, this represents a failure at the earliest stage of ethical analysis: the identification and prioritization of safety-critical, ethically relevant facts. Decisions were made that increased overall system risk in order to reduce training requirements and regulatory scrutiny. In doing so, the design and certification process violated the fundamental ethical obligation to prioritize public safety over cost, schedule, and competitive considerations in safety-critical systems.

### Ethical Framework and Analytical Approach
In analyzing the Boeing 737 MAX crisis, I treated the incident as a **sociotechnical failure** rather than a purely technical malfunction. I applied a structured ethical framework emphasizing:

- Identification of ethically relevant facts

- Stakeholder analysis

- Application of professional ethical principles

- Consideration of real-world constraints

This process began by separating verified facts; such as MCAS’s single-sensor dependency, expanded authority, and lack of pilot disclosure from assumptions made by Boeing, the FAA, and flight crews. This distinction was critical in reframing the crashes not as pilot error or unforeseeable failure, but as the predictable outcome of design and certification choices made under organizational pressure.

I then conducted a stakeholder centered analysis to examine how risks and responsibilities were distributed. Primary stakeholders included passengers, pilots, and certification engineers, while secondary stakeholders encompassed airline operators, regulators, Boeing management, and victims’ families. Using professional codes of ethics and the ASME/NSPE canon hierarchy, I evaluated conflicts between public safety, employer loyalty, and regulatory compliance. In safety critical systems, this analysis consistently placed public welfare above commercial and institutional interests, even when regulatory approval had been granted.

### Constraints, Culture, and Regulatory Oversight

To move beyond idealized ethical judgments, I incorporated practical constraints, including organizational hierarchy, regulatory delegation, economic competition, and limited individual influence. These constraints help explain how ethical failures persisted despite the presence of highly skilled engineers. Rather than excusing misconduct, this analysis revealed systemic weaknesses; such as fragmented responsibility, normalization of risk, and information silos that discouraged ethical escalation.

TThe role of regulatory oversight was equally significant. The FAA’s delegation of certification authority to Boeing, while intended to streamline certification, reduced the level of independent scrutiny applied to safety-critical systems. Combined with elements of regulatory capture, this structure weakened institutional safeguards and blurred lines of accountability. Engineers operating within this environment faced intense schedule pressure and uncertainty regarding responsibility for safety assurance. Nevertheless, the existence of practical constraints does not absolve ethical responsibility. When conflicts arise, professional ethical hierarchies consistently place the obligation to **protect public safety above employer loyalty or organizational objectives.**

### Lessons for Ethical Engineering Practice
The 737 MAX crisis highlights the importance of addressing ethical concerns before failures occur, rather than responding only after accidents happen. In safety-critical systems, ethical engineering requires anticipating how design choices, organizational pressures, and human interaction with automation can introduce risk. Many of the failures in the 737 MAX program could have been reduced through earlier preventative measures, including greater redundancy in critical systems, clearer communication with pilots and regulators, independent safety review processes, and stronger protections for engineers who raise safety concerns. Mandatory training for new automated systems and more limited delegation of regulatory authority are also essential to ensuring that safety is not compromised in the pursuit of efficiency or competitiveness.

This case demonstrates that engineering decisions do not exist in isolation; they propagate through organizational, regulatory, and societal systems, shaping outcomes far beyond individual design choices. Ethical engineering therefore depends not only on sound technical design, but also on institutional structures that encourage transparency, accountability, and ethical escalation. Empowering engineers to raise concerns without fear of retaliation is critical to preventing future failures. Upholding these principles is essential to protecting human life, maintaining professional integrity, and preserving public trust in engineered systems.
