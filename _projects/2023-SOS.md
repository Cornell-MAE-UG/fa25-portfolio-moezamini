## Project Overview
This project involved the design and implementation of a **Morse code SOS signal detector** using a single push-button input and multiple LEDs for visual feedback. Developed as part of a **Mechatronics course**, the project provided hands-on experience with embedded systems, timing-based input interpretation, and state-based logic.

The system interprets **short button presses as dots (.)** and **long presses as dashes (–)**, processes the input sequence in real time, and validates whether the user has correctly entered the international SOS pattern: **...---...**.

The project emphasized **timing analysis**, **finite-state machine design**, and **robust sequence validation**, serving as a focused exercise in embedded system implementation.

## Input Interpretation & Timing Logic
The core challenge of the system was distinguishing between dots and dashes using a **single physical input**.

Key implementation details:
- Button press duration measured using software timing thresholds  
- Short presses classified as dots  
- Long presses classified as dashes  
- Debouncing logic to prevent false transitions  

This approach translated analog human input into discrete digital symbols suitable for programmatic processing.

## State Machine & Sequence Validation
The Morse decoder was implemented as a **state machine** that tracked progress through the expected SOS pattern.

System behavior included:
- Step-by-step validation of each dot or dash  
- Immediate detection of invalid input sequences  
- Automatic reset upon incorrect entry  
- Successful detection only when the full **...---...** pattern was completed in order  

This structure ensured deterministic behavior and simplified debugging and verification.

## Visual Feedback & User Interaction
LEDs were used to provide immediate, intuitive feedback to the user:
- Individual LED flashes confirmed dot and dash detection  
- A distinct blink pattern signaled successful SOS recognition  
- System reset feedback indicated readiness for new input  

This real-time feedback loop improved usability and made system behavior transparent during operation.

## Engineering Takeaways
This project demonstrated how **simple hardware interfaces can support meaningful communication protocols** when paired with thoughtful software design. Translating timing-based human input into structured digital information required careful threshold selection, state management, and error handling.

The SOS Signal Detector reinforced foundational concepts in **embedded control**, **timing analysis**, and **finite-state machine design**.
