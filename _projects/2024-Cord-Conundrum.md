## Project Overview
**Cord Conundrum** is a user-centered product design project focused on solving a simple but persistent everyday problem: **tangled cables**. Based on survey feedback mainly from on-campus students at Cornell University, our team identified cable organization as a frequent source of frustration, especially for chargers, and small electronics used daily.

Working with teammates **Remy** and **Marco**, we designed a **stackable cord winder** that enables fast, repeatable cable management while minimizing desk and backpack clutter. The result is a compact, intuitive product that I now use every day.

## User Need Identification
The project began with a short survey distributed to students to understand common pain points related to cable management.

Key findings included:
- Frequent cable tangling in backpacks and desks  
- Time wasted untangling cords before use  
- Lack of compact, modular storage solutions  
- Desire for a system that works across different cable lengths  

These insights directly informed the design requirements and feature prioritization.

## Product Design & Functionality
The final concept is a **stackable cord winder** designed to be both **modular and space-efficient**.

Core design features:
- A simple winding geometry that prevents twisting and knotting  
- Stackable form factor for storing multiple cables together  
- Intuitive operation requiring no instructions  
- Compact footprint suitable for everyday carry  

The design intentionally avoids unnecessary mechanical complexity, favoring reliability and ease of use.

## Prototyping & Iteration
We rapidly prototyped multiple versions to evaluate:
- Ease of winding and unwinding  
- Stack stability  
- Compatibility with different cable types  
- Durability under repeated daily use  

Iterative feedback led to refinements in geometry and ergonomics, ensuring that the final design balanced usability with manufacturability.

## Engineering Takeaways
This project reinforced the importance of **human-centered engineering**. Even simple products benefit from structured user feedback, clear requirements, and iterative testing. Solving a real problem well often means **removing features rather than adding them**.

Cord Conundrum demonstrated how thoughtful design can improve everyday experiences through simplicity and intentionality.
