## Project Overview
This project was completed as part of my first undergraduate mechanical design course and served as an introduction to structured engineering design and CAD modeling. The objective was to select a real-world mechanical object and fully model it in CAD, with attention to geometry, materials, and functional interfaces.

I chose to model a functional manual can opener due to its appearance and well-integrated mechanical features. The project involved carefully analyzing the mechanism, identifying critical dimensions, materials, gear teeth, and subcomponents, and accurately recreating the full assembly in CAD using Fusion360. 

Beyond functionality, the project emphasized usability, simplicity, and manufacturability, providing a strong foundation in design intent, component interaction, and practical mechanical considerations that informed my later, more advanced mechanical design work.

## Design Process
The design followed a structured workflow typical of early-stage mechanical product development:

- Problem definition and identification of user needs  
- Concept sketching and comparison of alternative mechanisms  
- Selection of a final concept based on simplicity and effectiveness  
- CAD modeling and iterative refinement of individual components and assemblies  

Throughout the process, emphasis was placed on translating abstract concepts into a mechanically realizable system and gaining hands-on experience with parametric modeling, assemblies, and feature-based design in CAD.

## Engineering Takeaways
This project introduced core mechanical engineering principles that continue to inform my work:

- The importance of clearly defined requirements and user needs  
- Tradeoffs between performance, simplicity, and manufacturability  
- The value of CAD modeling as a tool for understanding mechanical interfaces and design intent  

Although simple in scope, this project established a strong conceptual and practical foundation for more complex mechanical systems developed later in my academic and extracurricular work.
